    <div>“Why are we still here? Just to suffer? Every night, I can feel my leg... And my arm... even my fingers... The
        body I've lost... the comrades I've lost... won't stop hurting... It's like they're all still there. You feel
        it, too, don't you? I'm gonna make them give back our past!” - Kazuhira Miller</div>
